# Signs and Symbols: Dress at the Intersection between Image and Realia

### Berlin, February 18–20, 2016


Dress research is a relatively young academic discipline and its methods are dynamic, drawing from the fields of visual
studies, linguistics, and cultural studies, and alternating between detailed empirical analysis of material culture and
its interpretation. Fashion in images (painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture) and in written works are typically
considered through the lens of art history and historical analysis, whereas the research on textiles and clothing tends
to favor technology-based methods of investigation. Yet not infrequently, it appears that the various specialized
interests are generating independent strands of research—leaving untapped the potential to create synergies and to
synthesize diverse research approaches. Seeking ways to address this desideratum will be one key aim of the planned
conference. “Cross-reading,” the juxtaposition of different source texts, requires particular meticulousness and a
thorough knowledge of the different research disciplines. Common to all the disciplines engaged in dress research is the
question of how to define and delineate the image-dress-fashion triad. In the framework of this multidisciplinary
conference, we want to bring about a reflection on applied methods and, with it, a collective self-positioning of the
disciplines with regard to dress. The overarching aim of the conference is to create synergies in the research on visual objects, dress, and accessories
by bringing together scholars from a range of disciplines in the humanities and empirical sciences whose research
engages themes of dress and fashion. The focus of discussion will be on methodical and methodological questions
surrounding the reconstruction of dress and its significance in visual and textual media.

## 1. Relation between image and written word

The following areas of emphasis and the questions they present all relate to two sides of the same coin: dress as
textile artefact and dress in images. Between these poles, dress functions as (body) image, both in real life and in
visual representations. Research on the repertoire of sartorial symbolism relies on both visual and textual sources.
What do these sources say about patterns of identification, ranging from distinction to conformity, within the context
of normative behavioral codes? And how do they affect the symbolic meaning of dress from the following perspectives?

1. Norm and form: Clothing regulations, ceremonial records, and police regulations show that ruling authorities’ efforts to enforce social norms required the development of ever more, and increasingly differentiated regulations and penalties—not only in the area of clothing regulations and sumptuary laws but also for the governance of society as a whole. Taking this legal history perspective as a point of departure, the conference will focus on the causes and impacts of clothing regulations.
2. Cultural transfer: Clothing and fashion were important trade commodities, which were also absorbed into the clothing styles of other courtly societies, although not without reinterpretation. Dress and fashion transfer unfolded on a spectrum ranging from conformity by means of assimilation to the establishment of distinction by means of adaptation. More concretely: What formal and semantic changes did the Parisian fashion of absolutism go through in neighboring countries? How were the costumes of Dutch regents of the 17th century adapted as they were incorporated into the dress of neighboring countries, and what elements of late 18th century English fashion were adopted?
3. Hybrid dress: Special attention will be paid to the designers of hybrid dress, who conceived decidedly inauthentic vestments in early modern painting and sculpture. Anthonis van Dyck’s portraits, for instance, depict women in fanciful garments that are not adequately understood to this day, and the inauthentic costumes depicted by artists from Donatello to Schlüter in equestrian statues and busts of rulers led ultimately to the academic “costume dispute.”
4. Caricature: The exaggerated forms of fashion found in caricature as a genre are semantically loaded, shifting between nationalisms, social critique, and gender problems. The conference will therefore explore on a fundamental level whether the art historical approach of iconographic-iconological analysis of visual motifs can do justice to the motif of dress and its cultural meanings or to the reconstruction of a “material culture.”

The planned conference will take up the critique of logocentric iconology to explore a hermeneutic approach to the
representation of things based on visual representations of dress. It will use these depictions as a means of examining
whether the meaning of objects in images can be deduced solely from their established textual and programmatic meanings.
Although certain objects were not the subject of scholarly humanistic or theological discourse in the early modern
period, these objects can still claim symbolic meaning. Whether south or north of the Alps, the symbolic meanings of
objects, and particularly dress, can be understood within the context of the visual world they inhabit. The realities
they generate may be temporally antecedent to textual reflection. In this context, a focus of the conference will be on
re-reading textual sources that have been understood in the fashion research up to now based on established patterns of
interpretation that are in urgent need of revision. These include non-descriptive sources, beyond ceremonial literature
and the systematic evaluation thereof, such as court records, wills, and inventories.

## 2. Empirical Research

The empirically oriented research, which focuses on surviving historical objects such as textiles, clothing ensembles,
accessories, and paintings, is conducted by experts in material science and art restoration. Their work involves
collecting data on historical textiles, paintings, and other artefacts, and studying the structure and construction of
objects or analyzing paint layers, color values, and the percentages of metals in pigments. Reading this information
requires in-depth, specialized knowledge of the discipline in question, whereas interpreting and applying the findings
to a larger context requires an interdisciplinary approach. At precisely these two junctures, frictions sometimes arise.
In interdisciplinary research teams, it is not uncommon to see that findings reported by empirical researchers first
have be translated into non-specialist language and then placed within the context of research questions in the
humanities. And while this can cause frictions, it can also lead to joint research questions. 

Surviving historical objects are of central importance for any reconstruction and interpretation of dress and
vestimentary cultures. Focusing on the interface of picture, text, and object sources, the conference will explore
methodological options that might be utilized more fully to promote transdisciplinary research, and will encourage
researchers to challenge and stretch the established methodological boundaries of their respective disciplines. This
will require a willingness on the part of researchers to engage in deconstructing their own narratives, established
theories, and historical models. This applies, for instance, to the fashion theory of Georg Simmel (1906), which
occupies a central place in fashion studies to this day and is undoubtedly just as relevant as it is in urgent need of
revision. Probing such sensitive methodological points will mean drawing connections between visual and textual sources
and objects, and comparing and interpreting them. In the second part of the conference, (restoration) reports from
collections will form the nucleus of a search for methodological orientation. A further aim of the conference will be to
supplement this search with reports from archaeological excavations, which have been the source of an increasing number
of vestimentary finds in recent years.

## 3. Concepts / Terminology

Between ethnology and cultural studies, broader questions of nomenclature arise, as the existing concepts—including
fashion, dress, traditional costume, and costume—are inconsistent in their definitions and interpretations. The concept
of fashion, for example, has gained prominence in scholarly work in recent years. It is based on Simmel’s theory of
fashion (distinction and adaptation) and is applied in historical research uniformly to all the centuries of early
modern history. Equally in need of revision are the terms “traditional costume” and “costume,” whose semantic
orientations have been revised inconsistently in the scholarship over the last few decades. These terms require critical
reassessment. In this terrain of methodological uncertainties, it is important to bring together various sources (visual
and textual material) and objects/artefacts (dress, accessories) and to find ways of analyzing and interpreting them.

### Call for Abstracts

**We invite scholars in art history, visual culture, fashion, history, cultural studies, archaeology, sociology, and
experts in textiles research and conservation, as well as literary scholars, anthropologists, legal scholars, and
economists to present their diverse perspectives on the development and significance of fashion and dress at the
conference.**

Please submit your proposal of ca. 3.000 characters as well as contact details by June 15, 2015.
Languages of the conference are: German and English.
